## What is it
QuickBans is a tool for league of legends. You can filter the champions in champion select by multiple champions by seperating them with the pipe ('|') character. QuickBans collects data from [bestbans.com](http://bestbans.com/) to create a customized preset of suggested bans for you!

The core idea was to create something which saves time by automatically suggesting the most banworthy champions.

## Getting started:
* As my programm is written in Java, please make sure you have java installed. ([Java download](http://www.java.com/en/download/win10.jsp))
* Download the executable jar: [Link](https://github.com/thamma/QuickBans/releases/download/v0.1-alpha/QuickBans.jar)
* Run it for the very first time. This will create the quickbans.cfg configuration file.

* (Optional) Use your favorite text editor to configure the quickbans.cfg file to fit your needs.
* Run it again! The programm finished working once you hear a **beep** sound.
* Now you're ready to go! Head into champ select and use your clipboard (Ctrl + V) to display the suggested bans!
