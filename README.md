# QuickBans

## What is it
A tool for League of Legends

## What does it do
Generates a list of smart ban suggestions and loads it to your clipboard. Easy as this.

## Why is it awesome?
Run it. Paste it. Ban it.

## How does it work?
It uses http://bestbans.com/ to figure out which champs are recommended.

## How to:
* Make sure you have java installed.
* Download: [Link](https://github.com/thamma/QuickBans/releases/download/v0.1-alpha/QuickBans.jar)
* Run it for the very first time
* (Optional) Configure the quickbans.cfg file to fit your needs.
* Run it again! You can tell it worked by the *beep* sound.
* Paste it! You have a premade string in your clipboard to be pasted in the baning phase
